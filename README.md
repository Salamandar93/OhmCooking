OhmCooking
=============
Ohm Cooking is an app that lists recipes. The particularity is that you can search for recipes based on ailments or benefits. 
For example, if you have a cold, the website will bring up recipes containing garlic, ginger etc.
If you want something that improves blood flow, it will bring up recipes with oranges or cayenne pepper.

We are trying to make a platform to help people eat better through cooking. It is essential that each recipe clearly shows all the benefits it contains, but also all that could be bad for you. For example x people often eat meat because it contains protein, but they ignore the fact that it gives cholesterol or promotes cancer. The application should be able to encourage people to reduce the quantity of the malicious ingredient, or even suggest an alternative. We are choosing meat as an example, but it could be sugar or bread.
